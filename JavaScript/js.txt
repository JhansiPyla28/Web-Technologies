HTML:design webpages
Static webpage:content is same
Dynamic webpage:content is change

CSS:Look and feel

Java Script: Scripting language-interactive webpages-mouse click,scroll etc

High level language-More abstraction-memory etc , interpreted language
Compiler interpreted language
Interpreted--Line by line(Performense problem)(JIT-provide byte code)

1995- Bremdon eich has invented this language-Initially live script and then converted into javascript

ECMA script(European community Machine Association) script principles

ES1

We are following ES6 version rules

We can execute at clent side or server side

Problem in client side:-If the js is executed in client side usser may disable js code in your browser

To overcome this we execute out js in server side

In server side--> PHP,nodejs,etc

With help of js i can create webpages,webapplications, smart watches-Pebble, mobile applications-native react js

We can define any kind of form validations,DOM manipulatioons

Hoe to wrte code:
Internal JS:
	<script type="text/javascript">

		//block of js

	</script>
style tag we can write only in head 
script can use in head and body too
External JS:
------------------------------------------------

Identifiers:
Variables: 3 ways
1)Var: funtion scope, 
2)Let: properly used
3)Cons

	JS is loosely typed language(no need to mention what type of data that user is given)

typeof() to find type

Datatypes

1)String:
declaring strings
var j="janu";
var s="siva";

concatenate two strings

console.log("hi"+"js"+"wecome");
j.tolowercase()
j.toupper()
j.split(" ";)
2)Object
	let k={a:"hai",b:2345};
	Var car={color:"blue",name:"ambassdor"}
3)Number
4)Null
5)Boolean etc
----------------------------------------

Operators:

Arithematic operta

Design a game to check the luck of the user how many times

Procedure:
Accept a number from the user and check whether this number is matched to the randomly generated number (>10 <100)

This process should be repated until he feels bored

if he selct bored option then it should shows how lucky he is
